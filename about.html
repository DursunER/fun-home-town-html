        THINGS NOBODY TELLS YOU ABOUT PAMUKKALE TURKEY

    </h1>

    <h2>
        1. Pamukkale Literally Means Cotton Castle 
    </h2>
    <p>
        ‘Cotton Castle’ isn’t just a fun name for Pamukkale’s travertine cliffs. 
        Cotton Castle is also the literal translation from Turkish. Pamukkale does sort-of resemble cotton from far away, 
        but to me it looked more like cauliflower. In Turkish, ‘cauliflower castle’ would be Karnabahar Kalesi.

        2. Nobody Actually Knows What a Travertine Pool Is Before Visiting Pamukkale
    </h2>
    <p>
    Don’t feel bad when you don’t understand even the most basic elements of what the terraces actually are before going to Pamukkale, Turkey. Thankfully you’ve come to the right place, because we want you to be smarter than your friends – so here’s a definition I found on the internet:

    Travertine (noun): a type of limestone formed by mineral deposits (in many cases calcium) commonly found around hot springs.

    <h2>
        3. The Travertine Terraces Are Created By Pamukkale’s Calcium-Rich Spring Water
    </h2>
    <p>
        I hooked you with the definition of travertine, now let me reel you in with more geological facts:

    There are 17 hot springs in the area that makes up Pamukkale’s travertine terraces.
    Pamukkale sits over a fault line that generates frequent earthquakes. Cracks in the earth created by the earthquakes allow thermal waters to reach the surface to create the hot springs.
    Hot springs deposits calcium over the terraces as the water trickles over the cliffs below.
    Over time, the water dries and the calcium petrifies, leaving the Cotton Castle with that perfect white color.
    Thousands of years of calcium deposits being layered on-top of each other creates the amazing travertine pools that you see today!

        4. Pamukkale Gets Absolutely Packed With People! 
    </h2>
    <p>
        Want to get that one picture of yourself on the edge of a beautiful pool with a perfect reflection of you dipping your toes in the water? Oh you do? Well so does everyone else! Be ready to crop your favorite pictures, master photoshop to edit people out, or be very very very patient.

        We visited Pamukkale at the beginning of October 2021, when global travel was still slowly recovering. It seemed to us that Pamukkale did not get the memo. But apparently what we saw was quiet. I don’t even want to know what it looks like when it’s open to all global travelers again.
        
        At the same time, I hope it happens soon because the local economy needs it! (Assuming visitors are supporting the local economy and not just showing up on a bus and heading back to wherever they came from without ever stepping a foot in the town.)
