    <h2> Interesting facts about Pamukkale </h2>

<p>
    A dramatic hillside location consisting of hot springs and travertine terraces, the stunning natural phenomenon of Pamukkale has been used as a spa for thousands of years.

    Approximately 400,000 years ago, modern Asia Minor experienced a series of devastating earthquakes. This resulted in the shifting in the valley of the Menderes River (historically the Maeander or Meander) and caused for the thermal waters lashing out to the surface. The hot springs which were created, as a result of this phenomenon, began to flow down to the surface of the plateau with incredible speeds (hundreds of liters per second). While these flowed, they simultaneously began to evaporate in the sun, thus resulting in the formation of travertine terraces and fancy slopes, which were filled with turquoise water. Because the water was saturated with carbonated calcium, the sediments, when solidified, resulted in the formation of white crystalline surfaces, terraces, stalactites, and pools.

    Pamukkale (pronounced pah-mook-kah-leh) is called the cotton castle by literal translation of the word ‘Pamukkale’ in Turkish. The Turks call it the cotton castle because of the similarities that these white mountain slopes have with the cotton plantations that are cultivated in central Turkey.
