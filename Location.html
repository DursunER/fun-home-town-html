<h2>
        Location:
</h2>
<p>
Pamukkale is located to the south central of the Aegean region of Turkey. 

It is about 19 km to Denizli city and a 2,5 hour drive from the resort town Kusadasi. 

This lovely, developing district Pamukkale is in Menderes Valley. It was inside the borders of Caria, Lycia and Phrygia and had a mixed population.

This unique land locates on a platform overlooking the Curuksu Valley, known as Lycos in antiquity. It is at altitude of 360 m. from the sea level and 70 m. from the Lycos Valley.

The calcium oxide-rich waters flowing down from the southern slope of Cal Mountain carried deposits and built these white travertines located on the north of the ruins, over the millennia, plateau.
